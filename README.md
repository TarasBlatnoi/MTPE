This program converts markdown to HTML and writes it to the file that you specify in the terminal. 
To convert md to HTML you need to prepare md file and write path to this file in the terminal then you will get your HTML file in the console of a terminal.
But if you want to save your HTML file somewhere you will need to add flag --out after path to your md file and after flag --out you need to write name of HTML file that you want.
That's all. Simple as that.
